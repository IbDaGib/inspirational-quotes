### Notable Prompts Used
- "Refactor my code to make it more manageable"
- "Set up my docker container from scratch"
- "Create test cases for core components"
- "Scrape this website's HTML to get the colorschemes variations"
- "Use {insert shadui component} to build {component}"
- "Create a .env file to store my API keys"
- "What is the difference between .env and .env.local"
